# Unity-DOTS

This Unity DOTS repo shows how to use the Unity **D**ata **O**rientated **T**echnology **S**tack.
The features are:
- Write and start Unity jobs
- Unity ECS declaration
- Unity GameObjectToEntitiy Component declaration

All examples can be found in separate scenes and do not need to be explained.
When a scene is started, you can immediately see the difference to conventional Unity programming.
